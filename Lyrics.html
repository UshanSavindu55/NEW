        Take me down to the river bend
        Take me down to the fighting end
        Wash the poison from off my skin
        Show me how to be whole again
        <br>
        Fly me up on a silver wing
        Past the black where the sirens sing
        Warm me up in a nova's glow
        And drop me down to the dream below
        <br>
        'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
        Hardly anything there for you to see
        For you to see
        <br>
        Bring me home in a blinding dream
        Through the secrets that I have seen
        Wash the sorrow from off my skin
        And show me how to be whole again
        <br>
        'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
        Hardly anything there for you to see
        For you to see
        <br>
        'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
        Hardly anything else I need to be
        'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
        Hardly anything there for you to see
        For you to see
        For you to see
